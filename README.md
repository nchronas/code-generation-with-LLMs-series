# code-generation-with-LLMs-series

I've started a series of articles focusing on code generation from LLMs. 

Here is a list of the articles

## ChatGPT

The first part focuses on using chatGPT. The reason is that it is the easier to use, it has a web page and requires no installation

[The first article of the series: exploring code generation for a dns resolver with ChatGPT using mutliple languages](https://github.com/nchronas/dns-resolver-chatGPT)

[The 2nd article of the series: focuses on generating code from ChatGPT for mutliple languages using existing code](https://github.com/nchronas/simple-ascii-menu)

[The 3rd article of the series: exploring unit testing the code from the previous articile using ChatGPT](https://github.com/nchronas/simple-ascii-menu-ut)

[The 4th article of the series: focuses on creating a simple protocol and generating from ChatGPT using mutliple languages](https://github.com/nchronas/simple-protocol-chatGPT)
